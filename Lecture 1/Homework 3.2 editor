### HOMEWORK 3.2.

# Find the dataset for CO2. Read the documentation. Using this data, create
# a crosstabulation (conditional frequency table) of plant by plant type.
# Note, you will have to use a function we have not demonstrated, but a function
# you saw in Demonstration 3.3.
# Last, single out the frequency of the Qn1 plants from Quebec.
# What is the count?
